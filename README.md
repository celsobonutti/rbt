# üê∏ rbt

A tool for building and testing projects without redoing work unnecessarily.

A very early work in progress!

## Hacking

For now, you'll need to have [the `nix` package manager](https://nixos.org/download.html) installed.
After that, you can either run `nix-shell` to get into a development shell, or [install `direnv`](https://direnv.net/) and run `direnv allow` to do the same whenever you `cd` here.
